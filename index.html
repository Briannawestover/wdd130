        <p> I am from Lehi, Utah and this is my last semester at BYU-Idaho. I think that coding is kind of cool. I took a coding class previously as an intermediate statistics student but it has been a few semesters. So, this is for sure a nice, but crazy refesher. I forgot what it was like to be so focused on making sure that I didn't make any typing errors. Those typos can really make you lose your mind! </p>
